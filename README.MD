Inter, the inter-server communications system
=============================================

Inter is (or will be) a system for Minecraft servers to communicate with each other, in confined groups or clusters.

This project is obviously in its baby stages. Watch this space!

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.x (I recommend Python 2.7)
* Twisted (And therefore Zope)
* PyYaml

Running
-------

* Starting the server: ```python run.py```
* Running the tests: ```python test.py```
